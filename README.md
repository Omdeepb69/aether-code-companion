Okay, buckle up, buttercup! Let's get this README looking sharper than Tony Stark's goatee. Here's the professional, yet totally not boring, rundown for Aether Code Companion.

# **Aether Code Companion** ✨

## DESCRIPTION

Think of me as your friendly neighborhood code assistant, passively watching your back. I learn your coding style and slide into your DMs (well, console) with suggestions to level up your code game. 🚀 Basically, JARVIS for your code, minus the mansion and witty banter... mostly.

## FEATURES ⚡

*   **Real-time Code Analysis:** Keeps an eye on your code as you write, like a digital guardian angel. 😇 Uses file watching or pretends *really* well to integrate with your IDE.
*   **AST Power:** Uses Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to understand your code's *actual* structure. Yeah, it's pretty smart. 🧠 No cap.
*   **Anti-Pattern Slayer:** Detects common oopsies (anti-patterns) and suggests cleaner, more idiomatic ways. ✨ Stay fresh.
*   **Style Sense AI:** Packs a simple ML model to learn your vibe and flag bits that look... off. 🤖 No Skynet vibes, promise.
*   **Non-Intrusive Nudges:** Whispers suggestions gently via console or a basic UI. No annoying pop-ups here. 😎 We cool?

## LEARNING BENEFITS 🎓

Get hands-on with agent-style AI (think monitoring & reacting), practical NLP for code (ASTs are legit!), and ML in dev tools. You're basically building your own mini-JARVIS – world domination sold separately. 🚀

## TECHNOLOGIES USED 🛠️

Built with some seriously powerful, yet surprisingly accessible, tech:

*   Python 3.x
*   `ast` (Python's built-in magic wand for code)
*   `watchdog` (For that eagle-eye file monitoring)
*   `scikit-learn` (The brains of the ML operation)
*   `json` (Keeping configurations tidy)
*   Maybe `Tkinter` or `PyQt` (If we're feeling fancy with a UI)

## SETUP AND INSTALLATION ⚙️

Alright, let's get this suit powered up. Fire up your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omdeepb69/aether-code-companion.git
cd aether-code-companion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Boom! You're in.

## USAGE ▶️

Ready for launch? Just run the main script. Tweak `config.json` if you feel like customizing the reactor core. ⚙️

```bash
python src/main.py # Or however you run your main Python script
```

## PROJECT STRUCTURE 🗺️

Where does all the magic happen? Pretty standard stuff:

*   `src/`: Holds the brains and core logic. 🧠
*   `tests/`: Keeps things honest with unit tests. ✅
*   `docs/`: Contains the blueprints and extra info. 📜
